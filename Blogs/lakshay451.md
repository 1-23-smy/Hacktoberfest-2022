 - "Security of a seed is not in just remaining in its shell, but to break its boundaries and to grow into a full fledged tree."

 - Almost all our life we are looking only for security whether we realize this or not. Most of our decisions whether related to education, profession, or social relations, we also look for options which are safe and followed by many others. We struggle so much, just to ensure our security but still we are afraid all our life and thus we fear from any kind of challenging situation.

 - Real security is the one which gives us the strength to accept any kind of challenge in our life. It makes us almost fearless and enables us to tackle any situation in our life.

 - This can only come when we strive to move out of our comfort zone and push ourselves to the next level. There is a great joy in moving out of our limited boundaries and living with challenges.
